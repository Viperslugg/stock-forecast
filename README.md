### **Time series analysis on stock closing prices**

This repo is designed with the sole purpose to predict the time series of the [Tesla stock closing price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/tesla-stock-data-updated-till-28jun2021), sourced from Kaggle,
using machine learning techniques such as RNNs and transformers, and statistical models such as the ARIMA/SARIMA and vector autoregression models. The work in this repository should give as much of an
insight into the various methods used for time series forecasting in general. It is still undergoing work in progress.

Disclaimer: the number of methods and ways of tuning them for better performance metrics are exhaustive.
